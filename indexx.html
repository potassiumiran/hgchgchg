            <h3>Capacitive Tactile Sensing Circuit in COMSOL</h3>
            <p>
                As part of my exploration into sensor technology, I developed a capacitive tactile sensing circuit using COMSOL Multiphysics. This simulation project involved modeling capacitive sensors that respond to touch and pressure, analyzing their behavior in varying conditions. Through this project, I gained insights into electrostatics, sensor design, and simulation techniques, demonstrating my proficiency in computational modeling and its application in sensor development.
